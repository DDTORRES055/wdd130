        Hi, I'm Astrid RodrÃ­guez. I'm from Mexico and I've lived in Mexico City
        all my life. It's funny because I have access to so many different
        attractions. If you decide to visit Mexico City, my recommendation is:
        Don't forget to eat a "Torta de tamal", which is so delicious. I love to
        dance, sing, and play the piano, and I'm so excited to start this
        Software Development path. I have previous elemental programming
        knowledge, and I have enjoyed every moment in front of my code screen. I
        hope each one of us can increase our programming abilities by doing our
        best during this course. Nice to meet you and, have a good day!
