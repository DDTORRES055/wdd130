      <p>
        Hi, I'm Astrid RodrÃ­guez. I'm from Mexico and I've lived in Mexico City
        all my life. It's funny because I have access to so many different
        attractions. If you decide to visit Mexico City, my recommendation is:
        Don't forget to eat a "Torta de tamal", which is so delicious. I love to
        dance, sing, and play the piano, and I'm so excited to start this
        Software Development path. I have previous elemental programming
        knowledge, and I have enjoyed every moment in front of my code screen. I
        hope each one of us can increase our programming abilities by doing our
        best during this course. Nice to meet you and, have a good day!
      </p>

      <p>
        Mexico City is a versatile place. If you're looking for fun and
        extensive kinds of activities, Mexico City is the best option. The
        legend says that our Mexicans' ancestors received a divine instruction
        to settle where they find an eagle devouring a snake. They found it and
        builded their civilization, even though it was over a lake. That's why
        Mexico City was constructed in this place. If you visit my state, you're
        going to find legends, history, art, recreational activities and even an
        archaeological zone in the middle of the city. If you come, don't forget
        to eat our famous tacos and elotes, or esquites.
